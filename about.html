<p>Currently, I work in a completely different industry, and I'm eager to learn more and more about coding so that I can embark on a career as a programmer. I took an introductory computer science course in college years ago, so I know a bit of Java, and now I'm on my way to learning Ruby. I'll share my thoughts and experiences here as I continue on as a Flatiron School student.</p>
